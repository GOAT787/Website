Hello! This is a practice travel website.
Basically, you'll see pages from different places and the current time at that place :))

It uses a very simple HTML and CSS structure, with some basic JavaScript.

I used a cat API as well just to practice!

You can access the website here: https://goat787.github.io/Website/index.html
